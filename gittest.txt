The wheels on the bus "git, git, git".
The spider in the spout tries git, git, git.
Changes have been gitting hard. Git, git, git.
Perhaps not pipes, but ands and ors?
Ands in git are good.
Tested git commit -a, bit weird, opens the git commit file.
git status shows what's staged
git log shows history of commits
    --pretty=oneline --since='*insert time here, like 5 minutes ago*'
